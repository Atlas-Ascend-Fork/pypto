 * \file kernel_bundle_dev_cache.h
 * \brief Process-wide cache of per-bundle control-flow-cache DEVICE buffers.
 *
 * The packed base-0 control-flow cache is copied host->device once per bundle (keyed by LoadedBundle::bundleKey,
 * a content digest -- NOT hashKey, which is equal across shape variants of one op) and reused across launches.
 * Cached device buffers live for the whole process; DevMemoryPool releases them at teardown.
